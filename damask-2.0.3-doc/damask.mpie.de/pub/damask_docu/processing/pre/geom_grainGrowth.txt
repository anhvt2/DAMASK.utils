---++ Purpose
Smoothens out interface roughness by simulated curvature flow. This is achieved by the diffusion of each initially sharply bounded grain volume within the periodic domain up to a given distance 'd' voxels. The final geometry is assembled by selecting at each voxel that grain index for which the concentration remains largest.
