Usage: postResults options [file[s]]

 Extract data from a .t16 (MSC.Marc) or .spectralOut results file.  List of
output variables is given by options '--ns','--es','--et','--ho','--cr','--
co'.  Filters and separations use 'elem','node','ip','grain', and 'x','y','z'
as key words. Example: 1) get averaged results in slices perpendicular to x
for all negative y coordinates --filter 'y < 0.0' --separation x --map 'avg'
2) global sum of squared data falling into first quadrant arc between R1 and
R2 --filter 'x >= 0.0 and y >= 0.0 and x*x + y*y >= R1*R1 and x*x + y*y <=
R2*R2' --map 'lambda n,b,a: n*b+a*a'  User mappings need to be formulated in
an incremental fashion for each new data point, a(dd), and may use the current
(incremental) result, b(ase), as well as the number, n(umber), of already
processed data points for evaluation.

Usage: postResults options [file[s]]

 Extract data from a .t16 (MSC.Marc) or .spectralOut results file.  List of
output variables is given by options '--ns','--es','--et','--ho','--cr','--
co'.  Filters and separations use 'elem','node','ip','grain', and 'x','y','z'
as key words. Example: 1) get averaged results in slices perpendicular to x
for all negative y coordinates --filter 'y < 0.0' --separation x --map 'avg'
2) global sum of squared data falling into first quadrant arc between R1 and
R2 --filter 'x >= 0.0 and y >= 0.0 and x*x + y*y >= R1*R1 and x*x + y*y <=
R2*R2' --map 'lambda n,b,a: n*b+a*a'  User mappings need to be formulated in
an incremental fashion for each new data point, a(dd), and may use the current
(incremental) result, b(ase), as well as the number, n(umber), of already
processed data points for evaluation.
