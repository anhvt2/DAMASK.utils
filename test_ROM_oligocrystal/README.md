# POD ROM for oligocrystal with different strain rates/temperature

## SPPARKS

Run `in.potts_3d` with hybrid phase-field/kMC with sufficiently long trajectory

## DREAM.3D

Sample orientation

## DAMASK

Make sure to use dislocation-density-based constitutive model for high-/low-strain rate with different temperature
