# Introduction

This sub-repository explores the connection of graph to RVE, to measure distance from RVE to RVE in terms of from graph to graph. We will establish the RVE from the discrete combinatorics and graph perspective.

Connection:
- 2d: two nodes of the graph will collapse if the edge shared between two *adjacent* pixels is removed.
- 3d: two nodes of the graph will collapse if the face shared between two *adjacent* voxels is removed.

We will address graph in terms of cut/edit distance, and maybe attributes of the nodes.
